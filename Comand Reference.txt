Snowboard Command Reference
---------------------------

init hostmask password

Initializes the bot with an admin user with the hostmask and password
specified.  This command is only enabled if the bot is run with the -i or
--init command line options.

For security, this command should only been enabled once, when the bot is
configured for the first time.

ident user password

Identifies a user to the bot by username and password.

Snowboard Flag Reference
------------------------
Flags work in two ways, if a flag is in the approved list, the user has
access to commands associated with that flag.  If the user has the same flag
in the deny list, those associated commands are expressly forbidden.

The deny list is processed first.

admin = User is an administrator, access to all commands unless denied.
quit = User can cause the bot to quit from IRC.
