Welcome to Blazing Umbra.  The rules here are simple.
1.  Don't troll, for anything. People, sex, RP, information, favors, lols, etc..
2.  Respect all players.
3.  Channel IC/OOC status is important.
4.  All side-channels are always IC.
5.  Ops do not deal in drama.
6.  Respect stories.
7.  Erotic situations are allowed in any RP room, within reason. So long as they don't disrupt from other play or upset any players.
8.  Speak up, no one has responsibility for you but you.
All OOC comments in an IC channel should be easy to tell apart, and kept to a minimum.  Most common are double parenthesis (()) but we also accept double brackets [[]] or even double braccers {{}} surrounding text.  This allows players to easily pick out OOC chatter, questions, and other such things and not make the mistake of replying to it as if it were IC.
Players will get a notice telling them when they join a channel that is IC.
More in-depth description of the rules can be found at http://home.blazingumbra.com/chat/rules.shtml but if you've got any questions, concerns, issues, opinions, please direct them to either an Op or cyclops@blazingumbra.com and we'll be happy to send you a reply as soon as we can.
