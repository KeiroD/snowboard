Channel based commands for me are...
^announcement - Replays the channel announcement (if one exists).
^button ::I::Target::I:: - Push a virtual button at a ::I::Target::I::, it might do something to them, to you, or both.
^chans - Displays a list of channels associated with the bot.
^desc - Displays the description of a channel, particularly useful in channels that are ::I::In Character::I:: and have particular settings.
^help - Displays this output.
^opme - Instructs the bot to give you privileges in a managed channel, assuming you have ::B::proper bot access::B:: and the bot has ops.
^reset - ::B::Channel Managers Only::B:: resets a channel topic back to default in a room where the topic is bot-managed.

You may also ask the bot to ping you and it'll display your current lag time.
