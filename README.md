Project Snowboard - an IRC bot written in Python for the Modern IRC communities.

## Purpose
There are a lot of IRC bots out there but many of them are very old code, or working on an old code-base.  What this project aims to do is to provide a flexible bot that works with the modern IRC server, where services and such are common place.

We are writing this in Python because it allows everyone to make their own edits without the need to recompile.

## Required Libraries
* irc

## Current To Do
All we have right now is to-do, as we're just starting, so this is going to be pretty simple and not sound like a good bot until we get the basics in place and can really start expanding into different features.

* Allow connect to IRC Server
* Allow use of SSL
* Provide option to accept all keys
* Provide way to identify Administrators
** Perhaps leverage use of NickServ on supported networks
* Provide framework for numeric access levels (and user flags?)
* Provide basic control interface via IRC
* NickServ or Q/X/Z ID Support for Ops

## Version History
